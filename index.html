  <p>-For my first selection, I chose <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/itisasifyouweredoingwork/">it is as if you were doing work.</a> <br> This game makes you complete tasks on an early 2000s desktop.You start as an intern and complete tasks to get promoted. </p>
  <p>-My second selection is <a href="https://neal.fun/password-game/">The Password Game.</a> <br> This is a fun game the challenges you to create a password that fulfills all the rules your password must have.  </p>
  <p>-For my final selection, I chose <a href="https://en.akinator.com/">akinator.</a> <br> A game that is very nostalgic to me. In this game, you think of a person or character and the genie will asks you questions to try and guess who you are thinking about. </p>
